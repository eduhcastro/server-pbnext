# [Server PBNEXT](https://reactjs.org/) &middot;

This project is specific to my other project on the NEXTJS platform.

* **Understand::** There are several requests on the website, almost all of which are linked to this API, this is not yet 100% and it is not meant to be.
Use this as a way to learn, innovate, any contribution is welcome.


## Installation and Initialization

Well, for this to work you must have the Server DATABASE 3.24++ and these tables:**:

* Use this [Script](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) to create the tables.
* You should also have to configure the [Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) according to the Client .
* Use the npm i command to install the dependencies.
* Start the server from server.js.

I recommend using and starting the project using Visual Studio code, if there is any problem, identify the error using the console provided in it.
